This story examines the lack of diversity in the children’s book publishing industry in the U.S. For the past decade, the number of children’s books by and about people of color has remained disproportionally low. Not surprisingly, a recent survey revealed that the book publishing industry is overwhelmingly white. 

The Cooperative Children’s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison collects annual numbers on the number of children’s books published by (and about) authors of color. I collated the data in line charts, tracking the consistently low percentages of children’s books by/about people of color. Initially, I used Datawrapper; under Miguel’s suggestion, I added a layer of interactivity (the percentages now appear when you hover over the lines!) using Infogr.am. 

Lee & Low, an independent children’s book publisher in NYC, conducted the Diversity Baseline Survey in 2015. It surveyed over 34,000 staff members in the U.S publishing industry and tabulated the breakdown of the industry by race, gender and sexual orientation. The results were best presented as a grouped histogram, comparing the breakdown of people by color in the industry to the U.S population. 

I’m interested in pursuing this story further, perhaps as a feature piece. As usual, the biggest challenge is time – I have to do lots more reporting, with publishers, editors, authors, and advocates to give this piece a human face and to dive deeper into the reasons for diversity in publishing. There is more data I’m interested in adding, including a chart showing the fastest growing reading demographic in the U.S (university-educated black women). 

Watch this space.
